I am working in a company that plays a role as dealer such that we buy products of the manufacturers and sell them online using our platform(kamdi24.de) or amazon and eBay. Therefore, we are always in competition with our competitors regarding prices of the products. This means, we want to offer the products a bit cheaper than our competitors and this should be done dynamically using the system, but controlled manually with dashboards, graphs and other tools. I want an efficient application that do generally the following:
- Web Scrapping: There should be a UI to input the URL of the product and the ID, classname of the html element containing the product number, Product name and Price for each product. This way I want to scrap and add our product from our website (kamdi24.de) and that product from the websites of our competitors for comparison. I want to add several products, and all the products should be scrapped given the url for that product. The products should be then stored in a database and listed. 
- Monitoring and analyzing: I should be able to set a time for regularly data scrapping and monitoring such that if I set every 1 hour, the app should scrap the price and information every 1 hour for that product and store it in the database and visualize. This way I want to regularly monitor the prices of the products from our competitors and compare it with our prices in a time lapsing manner. So the data should be stored and analyzed based on time. I should be able to choose hourly, daily, weekly and 14 days price charts for analyzing. If I select a product on the list, I should see the chart for the price of our product, and our competitors and see how the prices varied over the time. 
- AI price analyzing and suggestion: The app should be able to send those all the data about a product, or about all the products (optionally for one day, one week, or 14 days) to the GPT-4o model for analyzing and suggestion. The GPT-4o model should then analyze the time based data about the prices from us against our competitors and suggest us to set our prices with reasons. The response of the GPT model should be visualized user friendly for reading and viewing. Make sure that the information sent to GPT-4o model is properly time based. Just as an example: If our competitors increase the prices on 8:00 Ocklock in the morning, I also want to increase. If they decrease the prices in certain hours, I also want to decrease but with considering our own factors. I want to implement some effective price factors in the future such that how many of that products are in our inventory remained, how fast we want to sell the products, and so on. You can also suggest some Faktors that works. 
- You can also add some useful functionalities if needed. 

I emphasis on performance and efficiency of the app to work fast, has a nice UI, and do the fundamental tasks good.
